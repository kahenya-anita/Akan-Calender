# Akan Naming Calender

* This project features a generator that derives an Akan name corresponding to the day of the week that a user was born.

## Description

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week a child is born, and on the gender of the child.
This name generator takes a user's birthdate and gender information, and derives an Akan name.
